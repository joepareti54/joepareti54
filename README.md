### program jp-llama-langchain-2.ipynb

This program demonstrates langchain and SimpleSequentialChain  for a streamlined approach, where the output of generating a question directly feeds into generating an answer.

LangChain is a powerful framework that simplifies the construction of applications leveraging LLMs by abstracting 
the complexities involved in setting up, executing, and chaining calls to LLMs. 
The provided example shows how LangChain can be used to:

Generate a Question: Based on a user-specified topic, the program generates a thoughtful question.
Generate an Answer: Following the question generation, the program then generates an answer to the posed question.

In the direct use of SimpleSequentialChain, the chain is treated as a black box that takes an input and 
provides an output with less visibility or control over the intermediate steps. 
It's efficient for straightforward sequential processes but less so when you need to interact with or 
alter the process between steps.


### program jp-llama-langchain-3.ipynb

This program also uses langchain and manages each step explicitly without relying on SimpleSequentialChain 
for the entire process. You're able to clearly differentiate between the question and the answer, 
providing more tailored outputs and interactions.
